# Nilgiri Research Labs
# OVERVIEW
We are a small team comprising of 2 Virginia Tech students pursuing their bachelor's and PhD degrees respectively. We collaborate on problems that we find mutually interesting. We primarily engage in leveraging techniques and tools developed in fields like machine learning, neural networks, manifold optimization, and convex optimization to enable new capabilities in adaptive beamforming, radar detection and sensing, and wireless communications.

We have 4 "big" ideas for Adaptive Array Processing, that we are currently pursuing as part of the Phaser Challenge in RADARCON25, and this website will elaborate on ongoing work.

The name of our enterprise stems from our shared heritage of growing up adjacent to the Nilgiri Mountain Range in Tamil Nadu, India.
